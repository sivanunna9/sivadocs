===============================================

1. What is continuos integration?
   Continuous Delivery C.D?

	- C.I integration is nothing but continous compilation, testing and deployment.
	- C.I is a process which monitors the new changes coming into V.C.S like Git, checkouts the source code, builds the change, runs the test case to test the change and deploys it to given environment automatically (seemlessly) without any manual intervention.

2.How do you change Jenkins HOME directory??

Go to $USER_HOME/.bashrc and add below ENV variable.
========
export JENKINS_HOME=/home/sai/jen/.jenkins

3.Jenkins installation:
=====================
Approach:1	1. download JDK
	2. download Tomcat
	3. download jenkins.war
	4. copy jenkins.war to $TOMCAT_HOME/webapps
		[deploying jenkins to tomcat]
	5. start Tomcat server using $TOMCAT_HOME/bin/startup.sh
	6. Launch Jenkins using below URL
				http://localhost:8080/jenkins	
	7. command to shutdown tomcat:
			$TOMCAT_HOME/bin/shutdown.sh

  Approach:2
 ============
# Running jenkins direclty from command line. not suitable for production jenkins.
	Jenkins.war comes with a light-weight server called "jetty". below command runs jenkins in jetty server.

	- $ java -jar jenkins.war
you can launch jenkins using below URL:
				http://localhost:8080

   Approach:3
   ==========	
 sudo apt-get install jenkins


4. Why we need continous Integration?

  - C.I integration is nothing but continous compilation, testing and deployment.
	- C.I is a process which monitors the new changes coming into V.C.S like Git, checkouts the source code, builds the change, runs the test case to test the change and deploys it to given environment automatically (seemlessly) without any manual intervention.

5. Have you created jenkins job or just worked on existing jenkins environment? 
   -yes
6. How do you create a new build/jenkins job?
  1.Create a New Item.
  2.Create the freestyle project/pipeline project.
  3.Configure the job with git url, maven,exceute shell or jenkinsfile.
  4.Apply & Save.
  5.Build Now.

7. How do you install jenkins? What are the different ways?
	1. java -jar jenkins.war  [http://localhost:8080] [uses jetty server]
	2. yum install jenkins[RHEL] OR apt-get install jenkins [Ubuntu]
	3. Deploy jenkins.war in tomcat like any other web applications. [Production approach]

8. How do you setup a crontab in linux?
	Note: Refer Google and setup a simple crontab.
       - creating a new crontab.	
	 $ crontab -e (Edit your crontab file , create one if its doesn't already exist)
		====
		* * * * * `command/any-script`
		Minute   Hour	 DOM	 Month  DOW	
		0-59	 0-23	1-31	1-12	0-7
		====
      - list all crontabs
	 $ crontab -l
      - remove all crontabs
	 $ crontab -r	

9. How do you migrate jenkins from one server to another?
	- Install Jenkins in the new machine.
	- Copy .jenkins to new machine's $USER_HOME dir.
	- Start jenkins server in the new machine.
	[ Note: Usually, we don't copy workspace from old jenkins server to new as it contains large size of source code.]
	[command to exclude workspace.tar --exclude=workspace -cvf jenkins.tar .jenkins]

10. How do you start/stop jenkins?
    http://<jenkins.server>/restart
    http://<jenkins.server>/safeRestart
    http://<jenkins.server>/exit
    http://<jenkins.server>/safeExit
    http://<jenkins.server>/quietDown
    http://<jenkins.server>/cancelQuietDown

11. Jenkins is running some jobs and I want to restart it. How do you restart?
        http://<jenkins.server>/safeRestart
   - How do you restart th e jenkins without interrupting running jobs?
       http://<jenkins.server>/safeRestart

12. What is the default port number of jenkins?
     port-8080

13. What is the difference between Poll SCM & build periodically in Jenkins?
 Poll SCM periodically polls the SCM to check whether changes were made (i.e. new commits) and builds the project if new commits where pushed since the last build, whereas build periodically builds the project periodically even if nothing has changed.

14. How do you change the port number for Jenkins?
	Go to $TOMCAT_HOME/conf/server.xml
	Change port number in this line: [ port="8080" protocol="HTTP/1.1" ] p

15. How do you check Jenkins logs?
	How do you check your Application logs?
	$TOMCAT_HOME/logs/catalina.2017-08-08.log


16. What challenges you faced while working with Jenkins?
	- What are the common issues you see in Jenkins?
		- compilation
		- deployment
		- jdk or maven installation
		- disk space
		- port change


17. Where does Jenkins store global and job related configurations?
	Global configurations: $JENKINS_HOME/.jenkins/config.xml
	Job configurations: $JENKINS_HOME/.jenkins/jobs/job_name/config.xml


18. Where Jenkins stores all plugins data?
	$JENKINS_HOME/.jenkins/plugins

19.  what is extenstion of jenkins plugin?
       .hpi --->

19. I want to modify JDK version from 1.7 to 1.8 in 1000 jobs? How do you do it?
	Jenkins stores all configuration data in .jenkins/jobs/
	job_name/config.xml
	we can find 1.7 in all config.xml and replace it with 
	1.8 using some linux command or small script.
	Then to load the changes, we need to run "Reload configurations from disk"

20. How do you setup build and deployment for your project?
	- configure GIT URL
	- configure maven build command i.e 'mvn install"  ***********
	- go to post build section and call deploy.sh
	
	Deployment scritpt steps:
		- before copying the war file, our script checks 
		  for diskspace.
		- copy war file to all tomcat servers in an environment(copy using scp)
		- shutdown the tomcat
		- start the tomcat

21. How many builds you store in your jenkins.    **********

 mostly we save the 10 builds
22. How do you rotate logs for your Jenkins?  **************

23. How do you backup your jenkins data?
    thinback-up
    backup

24. How do you configure different jenkins jobs to run with different JDKs?

    Jenkins stores all configuration data in .jenkins/jobs/
	job_name/config.xml
	we can find 1.7 in all config.xml and replace it with 
	1.8 using some linux command or small script.
	Then to load the changes, we need to run "Reload configurations from disk"

25. How do you configure security for your jenkins? Are you using LDAP for authentication?
   

26. What is matrix based security? How do you provide access to your users?
   Go to manage jenkins - manage users -creates users -go to -global configurations security -give matrix based as per users access.

27. What is a plugin?
	What plugins you installed? Name few plugins which you have used?
====
1. Thin Backup -
Using Cron tab style/notion, we can schedule the backups for jenkins. We usually take backup for Jenkins home directory. Once we install this plugin, It adds "ThinBackup" section to "manage jenkins".


2. Job Configuration History plugin:
we can check job configuration history. for example-
who deleted a job or configuration
who modifed jdk version
who modified build trigger schedule
user addition/deletion..etc.
Once we install this plugin, we can see who has done what or who made what changes. It records the history of all user's modifications.


3. Shelve project:
    If we have large size of build log files, un-used jenkins jobs, Jenkins will become slow(as it has to scan all projects for generating reports). So, It's good idea to archive any un-used jenkins jobs so that jenkins don't scan the project. since this plugin archives the projects, we can restore them if we want in the future.

28. What are the different ways of installing a plugin? *********
	
29. What is "Reload configurations from the Disk"? when do you use this?
    when ever we are modifications the any jobs  using config.xml we need to restart the jenkins, that time we don't restart the jenkins use this reload configuration from the disk.
  
30. How do you take back up for only jobs? excluding WS? ********


31. How do you set up distributed builds?
	using master/slave concept

32. How many slave nodes you have? **********
    
---end---

33. What is a label?
    Label is a virtual name for one or more slave nodes using which we can tie a particular jenkins job to always run on a pariticular machine (Usually which has jdk6 or jdk8 or windows machine...etc.)


34. what kind of problems you faced with your jenkins so far?
        - Our Master server became slow. So to distribute the load, I implemented master/slave concept and today our builds are running in 4 slave nodes.
        - Regular compile / deployment issues.
		- Diskspace issues.


35. Suddenly my Jenkins instance became slow. What steps do you take to improve the performance?
		- clean up old jobs. may be by using shelve plugin
		- implement master/slave distributed concept.
		- may be improve the computing power for ex: RAM 	
			and CPU
		- Make sure your Master doesn't run any jobs. Just 
			keep it for serving jenkins trafic and schedule 
			all your builds in slave nodes.

36. how much you rate yourself in jenknins? ************

37. Do you have experience with .Net builds? **********


38. How do you upgrade jenkins
	- take a test machine
	- install the same old version of jenkins in the 
	  test machine.
	- copy .jenkins from old jenkins to test machine and bring the jenkins server up in test machine.
	- deploy the new war file to test machine.	
	- test few builds randomly in test Jenkins to see if everything works well as old jenkins.
	-  finally repeat the same steps in production/original 
		server.

39. Can you name few Jenkins Features? 
    - Jenkins is process improvment tool
    - using jenkins we can compile, run tests, build the code and deploy efficiently by continuously integrating users changes with existing application.
    - we can generate graps, statistics for our builds and test cases,
    - jenkins provides fast feed back when some thing goes wrong.
    - Jenkins is extensible coz it is plugin based and rich in features. 
    - jenkins can act as a nice reporting tool. it sends test case and any other report in html format with some nice colors.
    - helps to deliver the code to production very quickly with quality code by running the test cases.
    - allows us to run builds in parellel. so builds can run faster.
    - allows us to run different builds with different confiugrations seemlesly without much configuration complexity.

40. How do you setup Jenkins from scratch?  
     ##########
41. What are the prerequisites for Jenkins?

42. how do you deploy an application in tomcat?
    can you explain how the deployment happens for your 
	project?
        - we build war file as a final artifact
        - we have shell script for deployment.
		- It checks if tomcat/target machine is up and 
			running and has enough free disk space
        - it does shutdown the server 
        - copies the war file to webapps location
        - starts the server.
		- It also sends the email notifications to all users

43. What is the difference between web server and application server?
	web server serves static content: ex..
		html
		images
		javascript
	application server serves dynamic content:
		search results
		date conversion
		weather application

44. What is parameterised build job? How do you set it up?

45. What is build pipeline? have you created build pipelines?

46. how to change port number for Jenkins installation In Ubuntu 18.04.?

jenkins service
--------------
You can go to /etc/default/jenkins and add --httpPort=9999 or whatever port to JENKINS_ARGS.
Then you should restart Jenkins with sudo service jenkins restart.

jenkins jetty server.
------------------
nohup java -jar jenkins.war --port httpPort=9999 & >2&1

in tomcat
---------

1) Go to conf folder in tomcat installation directory

 e.g. C:\Tomcat 6.0\conf\
2) Edit following tag in server.xml file

<Connector connectionTimeout="20000" port="8080" protocol="HTTP/1.1" redirectPort="8443"/>
3) Change the port=8080 value to port=80

4) Save file.

5) Stop your Tomcat and restart it.


47. Jenkins scripted pipeline or declarative pipeline



To quote: "Scripted Pipeline offers a tremendous amount of flexibility and extensibility to Jenkins users. The Groovy learning-curve isn’t typically desirable for all members of a given team, so Declarative Pipeline was created to offer a simpler and more opinionated syntax for authoring Jenkins Pipeline.

The two are both fundamentally the same Pipeline sub-system underneath."

Script Block in Declarative Pipeline
-----------------------------------
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Example') {
            steps {
                echo 'Hello World'

                script {
                    def browsers = ['chrome', 'firefox']
                    for (int i = 0; i < browsers.size(); ++i) {
                        echo "Testing the ${browsers[i]} browser"
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
Conditional Statement if, Scripted Pipeline
------------------------------------------
node {
    stage('Example') {
        if (env.BRANCH_NAME == 'master') {
            echo 'I only execute on the master branch'
        } else {
            echo 'I execute elsewhere'
        }
    }
}
}

48. How to reset Jenkins security settings from the command line?

The simplest solution is to completely disable security - change true to false in /var/lib/jenkins/config.xml file.

<useSecurity>true</useSecurity>
Then just restart Jenkins, by

sudo service jenkins restart
And then go to admin panel and set everything once again.

If you in case are running your Jenkins inside k8s pod from a docker, which is my case and can not run service command, then you can just restart Jenkins by deleting the pod:

kubectl delete pod <jenkins-pod-name>
Once the command was issued, the k8s will terminate the old pod and start a new one.



One other way would be to manually edit the configuration file for your user (e.g. /var/lib/jenkins/users/username/config.xml) and update the contents of passwordHash:

<passwordHash>#jbcrypt:$2a$10$razd3L1aXndFfBNHO95aj.IVrFydsxkcQCcLmujmFQzll3hcUrY7S</passwordHash>
Once you have done this, just restart Jenkins and log in using this password:

test
