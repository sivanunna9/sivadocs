INTERVIEW QUESTION:
=====================
1.What are the differences between ANT and Maven

2.How do you create a jar/war file in Maven?

 using $ mvn install command 

3.What is the  difference between mvn deploy and install?

mvn deploy command will deploy or copies war/jar into remote repository like nexus wehre as mvn install command will copies jar/war in to local repository like .m2 repository 

4.Can you explain Maven's lifecycle?
		'mvn install' command executes below maven "build life cycle" phases automatically. 
	- validate
		validate project's structure
	- initialize
		prepares project with initial pre-
		requisites ex: setting properties, creating 
		necessary directory structure..etc.		 
	- compile
		compiles "main" java code.
	- test-compile
		compiles "test" java code
	- test
		Runs the test cases.
	- package
		creates jar/war.
	- install
		copy built artifacts to local repository .m2/repository/groupId/artifactId/version/jar(or..war file)
        - deploy 
           The final package will be copied to a remote repository, may be as a formal release and also made available to the other developers too.

	[Give one line explanation about each phase during your interview]

5.What is Maven? Why we use Maven?
1. Maven a “build tool”: a tool used to build deployable artifacts from source code.
2.Maven is a project management tool which encompasses a project object model, a set of standards, a project lifecycle, a dependency management system, and logic for executing plugin goals at defined phases in a lifecycle
3.Maven can then apply cross-cutting logic from a set of shared (or custom) plugins.

6.While building the project, you get an error saying some jar file is missing. how do you add that?
 we can the dependency in the pom.xml file.
7.What is groupId, artifactId, and Version in Maven?
 
artifactId - project name
groupId - packagename 
version - project version

8.What are the Maven co-ordinates?

Maven co-ordinates GAV parameters

9.What are the mandatory attributes in pom.xml.

GroupId, artifactId, and Version 

10.What is the difference between 1.0-SNAPSHOT(SNAPSHOT) version and 1.0-RELEASE(RELEASE) version.

In case of Version, if Maven once downloaded the mentioned version say data-service:1.0, it will never try to download a newer 1.0 available in repository. To download the updated code, data-service version is be upgraded to 1.1.

In case of SNAPSHOT, Maven will automatically fetch the latest SNAPSHOT (data-service:1.0-SNAPSHOT) everytime app-ui team build their project.



11.What is the default naming convention of an artifacts(jar/war) in Maven?
Package naming convention:
	artifactId-version.jar


12.How do you generate a site in Maven?
- using mvn site 
13.How do you run a clean build in Maven?
 -mvn clean
14.how do you add a dependency in Maven pom.xml?

 Go to the pom.xml file and add the required dependency in dependiencies.

15.what is a plugin?
 Really just a plugin execution framework where every task is actually done by plugin.
 a plugin generally provides a set of goals,which can be executed using folling syntex 
    mvn [plugin-name]:[goal-name]
   for example mvn complile:complie()
Plugins are dynamically downloaded and installed.

16.What is the default path of artifacts in local repository?
 $USER_HOME/.m2/repository/groupId/artifactId/version/jar_or_war_file_name
17. Where maven stores the built artifacts? 
 $USER_HOME/.m2/repository/groupId/artifactId

18.How do you create a project in the Maven?
Creating a Java Project using Maven:
mvn archetype:generate -DgroupId=com.gamutkart -DartifactId=gamutkart -Dversion=1.0-SNAPSHOT -DinteractiveMode=false

Create Maven web application project usgin below command.
$ mvn archetype:generate -DgroupId=com.flipkart -DartifactId=flipkart -Dversion=1.0-SNAPSHOT -DinteractiveMode=false -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-webapp

19.What are the different binary repositoris we have? Which one you are using for your project?

Maven repositories
	- Central
	- Private/Remote (Nexus/atifactrory)
	- Local (.m2)


20.How do you customize the name of your artifact(jar/war) in Maven?
         <build>
                <finalName>gamutkart</finalName>  (only target folder naming convention will change)
        </build>
        

21.How do you change the name of built jar/war file in maven? what changes you need to do in pom.xml file?
   <build>
                <finalName>gamutkart</finalName>   (only target folder naming convention will change)
        </build>

22.What do you mean by transitive dependency in Maven and can you explain how maven resolves it?
 maven have capability to get transitive dependency it, means hamrest.jar is dependency of Junit and becomes transitive dependency for our project
It means to directly specify the versions of artifacts to be used when they are encountered in transitive dependencies. For an example project C can include B as a dependency in its dependencyManagement section and directly control which version of B is to be used when it is ever referenced.

23.What is the significance of scope parameter in dependency section?
This scope is used to limit the transitivity of a dependency, and also to affect the classpath used for various build tasks.

The <scope> element can take 6 values: compile, provided, runtime, test, system and import.

24.What are the different scope's we have in Maven?

 Dependency scope includes dependencies as per the current stage of the build. Various Dependency Scopes are −

compile − This scope indicates that dependency is available in classpath of project. It is default scope.

provided − This scope indicates that dependency is to be provided by JDK or web-Server/Container at runtime.

runtime − This scope indicates that dependency is not required for compilation, but is required during execution.

test − This scope indicates that the dependency is only available for the test compilation and execution phases.

system − This scope indicates that you have to provide the system path.

import − This scope is only used when dependency is of type pom. This scope indicates that the specified POM should be replaced with the dependencies in that POM's <dependencyManagement> section.
