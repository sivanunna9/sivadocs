## What is Ansible
Ansible is a modern IT automation tool which makes your life easier by managing your servers for you. You just need
to define the configuration in which you are interested and ansible will go ahead and do it for you, be it installing
a package or configuring a server application or even restarting a service. Ansible is always ready to manage your
servers.

## Why do we need Ansible

Managing a infrastructure/environment is easy. Managing 5 is do’able. Managing hundreds or more is a painful task without automation.
Ansible is designed to be simple and effective. You can create identical, replicable servers and clusters of servers in a
painless and reliable manner

## Ansible offerings

Configuration Management
Deployments
Provisioning
Orchestration :: Different tasks on different hosts

## Why use Ansible

It is a free open source application by RedHat
It is Idempotent which is extremely important and useful 
Cross Platform Support --> Installed ansible in Ubuntu ---> deployments to be done in CentOs/Fedora/RHEL/Windows
Agent-less Architecture 
Highly flexible and configuration management of systems
Large number of ready to use modules for system management 
Custom modules can be added if needed
Configuration roll-back in case of error 
Simple and human readable as it follows YAML langauge
Easy to manage in VCS and easy also easy to build CI pipeline
Self documenting


Installation of Ansible

$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install software-properties-common
$ sudo apt-add-repository --yes --update ppa:ansible/ansible
$ sudo apt-get install ansible

## Ansible Architecture

sudo apt-get install ansible

Ansible.cfg
	This the location where all configuration settings can be managed
	Default location is /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg
	/opt/gamut/deployments --> place all our ansible configurations
	
	Precedence
	1. ANSIBLE_CONFIG		--> create ansible.cfg file and export ANSIBLE_CONFIG=location of file
	2. ./ansible.cfg
	3. ~/.ansible.cfg
	4. /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg
	
	
	
	Main sections are --> 
						Defaults :: most of settings listed here ( inventory, remote_user, ask_pass etc )
						Privilege Escalation :: like Sudo. Defines operations that require escalated privileges in managed hosts for "Unprivileged user"
												become=true (non-privileged user)
												become-method=sudo
												become-user=root
												become-ask-pass=false
Paramiko-connection, SSH-connection, Accelerate :: settings to optimize connections to managed hosts
Selinux :: SeLinux Settings
Control Nodes --
	Managed by Admins which has copies of all projects. 
	Control Node will run playbooks.
	Control Node is the Ansible Server
	
Managed Hosts --
    server will have an IP 11.22.33.111 or DNS bng.gamut.com
	These are servers listed in the host file
	Servers can be clustered and can be in groups for easy deployments
	Authorized_key Module with ask-pass option
	
Modules -- 
	Every action ( task ) which needs to take place from Control Node to Managed Node is done using Ansible Modules
	Hundreds of supported modules are already available for Linux/Windows.
	Custom Modules can also be built using Python
	Modules will inturn have actual tasks they have to perform
	ansible-doc -l ( lists all modules installed )

	Location of all Ansible Modules ::
		https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/modules/modules_by_category.html

YAML
	should start with three -
	end with three .
	No tabs
	follows strict indendation, always by 2 spaces
	follows key value pair model. eg training: ansible
	Strings can be without quotes, single quotes and double quotes
	\n characters should be in double quotes
	integers are automatically interpreted, example a = 1
	integers should not be in double quotes, if it is then it is a string
	list represened as below
		- example 1
		- example 2
	
	ansible-playbook abc.yml --syntax-check


Inventories -- 
	Managed hosts are defined in inventories
	Inventories can be Static or Dynamic. 
		Dynamic inventories 
			Few examples of Dynamic Inventories --> DB, Docker Containers, AWS Public IPs, New Infra with provisioning
			achieved by using external scripts, these scripts are not officially supported by RedHat
	Location of inventory files can be defined in Ansible.cfg file or while execution of playbook
	Inventories can be classified into groups and few examples below
	
	/opt/gamut/deployments ---> project Location
	inventories
	abc.yml
	
	ansible-playbook -i /opt/gamut/deployments ansibletraining.yml
	
	1
		[webservers_dns]
		bng.gamut.com  connection=local
		chennai.gamut.com ansible_user = ubuntu
	2
		[appservers_ips]
		11.22.33.44  port = 2000
		11.22.33.45
		
	3	[databaseservers]
		bng.gamut.com
		11.22.44.55
	
	4	[wwgroup:children]
		webservers_dns
		appservers_ips
		
	
	5	[gamutservers_range]
		server=bng23.gamut.com
		bng[01:09].gamut.com
		bng01.gamut.com
		bng02.gamut.com
		bng03.gamut.com
		etc
		
	6	192.168.[4:7].[0:9]
		192.168.4.0
		192.168.4.1
		192.168.4.3 ( 50- 60 ips in this range )
		
	7   You can exclude groups as well, for instance, all machines must be in the group webservers but not in the group phoenix:
		webservers:!phoenix	
	
	  
		

Ansible Facts -- 
		they are variables that are automatically discoverd by ansible while running playbook. It will run setup module by default
		Facts contain host specific information that can be used as variables in plays
		Few facts which will be considered/picked up by ansible from Managed Node::
		host name, ip address, OS version, various system environment variables, number of CPUs, available disk space etc
		use cases: 
			run database update only when available disc space is more than 10GB
			restart the managed host based on the OS version
			
	Gather facts by using below ansible command ::
				ansible bng01.gamut.com -m setup (setup is the module)
				can be accessed through debug module
				
				hosts: all

  # Task: the list of tasks that will be executed within the play, this section
  # can also be used for pre and post tasks
  tasks:
    - name: Show IP Address
      debug:
        msg: "{{ ansible_default_ipv4.address }}"
		
	We can have custom facts as well, but they are useful only on control node. default location of facts is /etc/ansible/facts.d
	if we need these facts in the Managed hosts as well, then we will need to copy this file to the remote machines using file and copy modules
	##name of file is "date"
	#!/bin/bash
	echo [date]
	echo date=`date`
	
	ansible {ip/hostname} -m setup -a 'filter=ansible_local'
	

	
	
	* we can turn off gathering facts by setting them to NO
				gather_facts: no
							

	Group-Variables --
	
	user = ansible
	key 	value
	gamutwarfile = /opt/gamut/softwares
		
	Host-variables --> Variable in playbooks are very similar to using variables in any programming language like java, python, shell scripting etc. 
	It helps you to use and assign a value to a variable and use that anywhere in the playbook
	These are variables that are declared in the playbook
	Variables in playbook could be path of particular file or deployment location or any other repeated items
	Variables are very helpful in managing ansible playbooks in clean and efficient way
	
	Host-variables examples --> vars, vars_files ( Yaml or txt), vars_prompt ( private /yes or no)
	
	correct naming   :: web_servers, app_servers, webservers
	Incorrect naming :: web server, web.server or app$server
	
	ansible-playbook -i aa/bb/cc -e "{{name}}" ansibletraining.yml 
	
	Precedence     --> CMD (Global Scope ) -- playbook ( play Scope ) -- inventories ( Host Scope )
	Important note --> Playbook should not start with variable. if it starts, then it has to be within quotes.
	Recommended    --> to define group variables under separate directory and not directly under inventory file/s
	
Playbooks --

	Play is set of tasks which should run on hosts as per inventory and sequentially in order
	Playbook is a set of single or multiple plays
	Playbook is heart/core feature of Ansible and is an organized unit of scripts that defines work for a server.
	Playbook is a combination of name, user, hosts, variables, modules, roles
	Playbooks are human-readable and self documented and they follow yaml syntax
	Playbooks are run using ansible-playbook command 
	
		Sample-simple-playbook:: ansible_test.yml
		
		
		---
		
-->		- name : Deployment of file
		  hosts : gamutservers_range
		  remote_user: ansible
		  become:true
		  become_method: sudo
		  ask_pass: false
		  gather_facts:yes/no
		  
		  roles:
          - deploy

		  post_tasks
		    - name: copy file activity
			  copy:
		        src: /opt/gamut/documents/ansible.doc
			    dest: /tmp/ansible.doc
				
			- name: copy file activity
			  shell : cp /opt/gamut/documents/ansible.doc /tmp/ansible.doc
			
			- name : adding line in the ansible.doc
			  lineinfile:
			    path: /tmp/ansible.doc
				line: 'this is for demo'
				state: present
				
			- name: Idempotent approach 
			  copy:
			    dest: /tmp/ansible.doc
				content: 'this will check if file exists, and will not re-write if already exists'
			
			- name: start tomcat service
			  service:
			    name: tomcat
				enabled=true
				state=started
				
	** check syntax of playbook :: ansible-playbook --syntax-check ansible_test.yml
	Important Note --> Shell and Command modules are non-idempotent

---------
	
Playbook --> hosts, user information, modules, tasks, roles
	
Roles --

	Roles are repeated activities which are common for provisioning/deployment process
	This simplifies writing complex playbooks, and it makes them easier to reuse
	Roles are small functionality which can be independently used but have to be used within playbooks.
	Roles are not playbooks and they cant be independently executed
	Ansible Galaxy is the place to find roles
	There are hundreds of predefined roles available in Ansible-Galaxy which can be just used as Plug and Play 
	Note -- Due diligence of private roles needs to be done before integrating them to the playbooks
	
	www.galaxy.ansible.com
	ansible-galaxy install user.appname
	by default, place these roles in /.ansible/roles
	
	

	
	We will create playbook
	we will run playbook
	and we will install Java using role which is integrated in the playbook
	
---------

Creation of CN and MN

Create two EC2 instances/virtual machines -- CN and MN
Install GIT Maven in CN
try any sample war file from github
SSH connectivity Establishment from CN to MN
You should have atleast 2 machines, one for CN and one for MN
	Generate RSA pair in CN and MN
	Copy public key from CN and place in authorized_keys in MN
	test the connection using SSH (Secure Shell Protocol)
	
---------


----------

Establish Ansible CN connection to MN

	try ansible all -m ping	
	add ip of MN to the hosts file
	Test MN connection by Ansible ping module
	Check MN requirements
	Install Python --> sudo apt-get install python
	try now using 
		ansible gamutservers -m ping OR
		ansible all -m ping
	Now, you have successfully established ansible connection with MN

--------------------------

how to start your practice
IMP : get your basics right and be strong conceptually


1. create two machines in AWS free tier account. Else, you can practice Locally 
2. establish SSH connection between CN and MN --> not applicable if you are practicing locally
3. update hosts file with new publich IP of MN --> localhost with 127.0.0.1 as IP
4. test with ansible -m ping all/webservers/ip/dns --> make sure default location /etc/ansible/hosts is also updated
5. Python will not be installed and hence it will not be able to connect. Why in CN installed by default?--> because Ansible installation will bring dependency Python package as well
6. Java not installed in MN --> install through CN by ansible-galaxy role
7. Install Tomcat --> galaxy role
8. Playbook with roles and deployment script
9. You may find issues, debug on your own which will give better understanding
