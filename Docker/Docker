		Docker - The Container Virtualization Tool
	==================================================
Day-1:
######
#
Diff bet'n Physical server, Virtual server and Docker container.

VM, Docker, usage in realtime

#
what is docker? why docker? who can use it?
docker container is run time instance of an image & developers,QA	
#
Supported Platforms-
	- Docker is supported on
		- Linux platforms
			Ubuntu, RHEL, CentOs..etc.
		- Windows  
		- OS X 		
		  
	- Cloud Platforms
		Amazon EC2
		Rackspace Cloud
		Google compute Engine..etc.
		Azure

Note:
Linux containers can be created on Windows and OS X.
HOW?- Windows Docker installer contains a tiny Linux virtual machine. Docker creates linux container on top of this tiny Linux VM.


Requirements:
	- 64-bit architecture	  
	- Linux 3.8 or later Kernel versions


#
Requirements Check:
- Check Kernel version
	$ uname -a Or -r

NOTE: Kernel can also be upgraded.

- Check OS name:
	$ lsb_release -a / -cs
	$ cat /etc/os-release	


Installation Steps:
===========	==========	
# Update apt-get cache
	$ sudo apt-get update

# Install docker dependencies
	$ sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common

# Add GPG key to apt repository
	$ curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -

# Setup Stable repository:
	$ sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable"
	
# Update apt package index:
	$ sudo apt-get update
	
# Install Latest version of Docker
	$ sudo apt-get install docker-ce

#
Installation Check
sudo docker --version

#
uninstall docker:
$ sudo apt-get remove docker-ce


DAY-2
#
Managing docker containers
===============================
#
docker run command:
- "docker run" command provides all lanuching capabilities for docker to create a container.
- we use `docker run` to create new containers.


# Creating first container

sudo docker run -i -t ubuntu /bin/bash

	-i : opens STDIN from the container
	-t : tells docker to assign a pseudo-tty to the
		 container.
	-it : provides interactive shell
	
	`ubuntu`: is an image and also called as "stock image" or "base image".
			  This will be downloaded by default from 'Docker hub' for the first
			  time.
	
	/bin/bash: which shell need to be installed in the terminal



# Inspect the new container
1.
	hostname
2.
	cat /etc/hosts
3.
	apt-get update
	apt-get install net-tools
4.
	ifconfig
		observe etho and lo network interfaces with 
		ip address
5.
	ps -ef



How to create the container end to end point

1. Create container using below command 
docker run --name gamut -it ubuntu /bin/bash
2. Create a user using below command
adduser --home /home/satya --shell /bin/bash satya
3. Install vim using below command
  apt-get update 
  apt-get install vim 

4.Setup SSH for the container
	ssh gamut@172.17.0.2

step1:- First you can create a two containers like server1 (172.17.0.2) server2 (172.17.0.3)

stpe2:-
- Install ssh server
$ apt-get update
$ apt-get install openssh-server
$ apt-get install sshpass

step3:-

- Create an user and set up password
$ useradd -m -d /home/gamut -s /bin/bash gamut
$ passwd gamut
$ adduser --home /home/satya--shell /bin/bash satya

step4:- 
- Start the server
$ service ssh start (status/stop)

step5:-
	
- Connect to the container using ssh
$ ssh bunny@172.17.0.2

step6:-if you want to check the add user details please use this delow commmand.
$ vim /etc/passwd


#
Shutdown a container
"exit" to stop the container

# List all containers(stopped and running)
sudo docker ps -a

# List running containers only
docker ps

# ps command output shows
	- Image name from which container is created
	- ID - container can be identified using short UUID, longer UUID Or name.
	- Status of the container (Up / Exited)
	- Name


# See longer UUID of the container 
	$ docker ps -a --no-trunc -q"

# show the last container which you have created(stopped/running)
sudo docker ps -l

# Naming the container
	docker run --name gamut -it ubuntu /bin/bash

Note: Two containers can't have the same name.

# Rename a container
$ docker rename db-server3 db-server-name3

# Deleting a container
$ docker rm ID/name


#
docker info

# Delete all containers at once.
 $ docker rm `docker ps -a -q`


# Starting a stopped container
	sudo docker start gamut
	sudo docker stop aa3f365f0fdocker4e
	sudo docker restart gamut

# Shortcut Keys
	Ctrl + p + q - push a running container in background mode.
	Ctrl + d -  short cut to 'exit' from the container.
	

# Attaching to a running container
	docker attach gamut
	docker attach b1b1c8dc1939
	

# List Stopped containers only
$ docker ps -a -f status=exited
	Where Status can be exited / running


DAY-3:
	# Inspecting the container's processes from host machine
	- docker top <container-name>


# Stoping a container from 'host machine'
	- docker stop dgamut
	- docker stop ee319cddd42e(SIGTERM)
	- docker kill dgamut (SIGKILL)

# Show last 4 containers (stopped/running)
	- docker ps -n4


# Find More About The Container
- docker inspect comamnd "interrogates" the container and returns the info like.. configuration info, names, commands, n/w configurations, stopped/running ..etc.
	 
	 Examples:

    $ docker inspect <container-name/id> ( it will shows container details)
    $ docker inspect <container-name/id> | grep IPAdress | tail -1
   $ docker inspect <container-name/id> | grep IPAdress | tail -1 | cut -d ':' -f2 | tr -d '|,|"'
       this command shows  IPaddress of the running containers using multiple command append in one command using (|) pipe symbol
  $ sudo docker inspect -f '{{.Name}}' `sudo docker ps -a -q`
    this command will shows the all container names

 $ sudo docker inspect -f '{{.Name}}' $(docker pa -a -q --no-trunc) | cut -c2-
      shows the commands the all containers names without "/"
         -c2- gives you first character of container name (ex.c) 



	$ docker inspect dgamut

	$ docker inspect --format '{{.Config.Hostname}}' dgamut

	$ docker inspect -f '{{.Name}}','{{.NetworkSettings.Networks.bridge.IPAddress}}' `docker ps -q`

	
   	Note: use --format (OR) -f  	


- Remove all running containers
		docker rm -f `docker ps -q`



DAY-4:
# Docker Images
=================
Agenda:
	- Understand docker Image
	- Create docker Image
	- Store docker Image
	- Share your own Image
	- Examine repositories that hold images

- Docker images are the building blocks for creating container.
- From images, we launch containers.
	
# Listing docker images
	- docker image ls

- Images live in '/var/lib/docker/image/aufs/imagedb/content/sha256'
- Containers live in /var/lib/docker/containers


DAY-5:
PROJECT-1:
============
#
SETTING-UP NGINX SERVER ON UBUNTU MANUALLY:
--------------------------------------------
 sudo apt-get update
 sudo apt-get install -y nginx

 start/stop/restart nginx server:
=========== 			
 sudo service nginx start
 			  nginx stop 
			  nginx restart
			  nginx status

Web content/Deployment path: /var/www/html

Uninstall nginx:
sudo apt-get purge nginx nginx-common


# Building our own Image
	We have 2 Ways to create docker image:
		1. docker "commit"
		2. docker "build" cmd & Dockerfile

# Creating docker image using "docker commit" command
Problem:
	Ship an application with ubuntu, nginx web server and code to your customer.


	- create container
	
	- Install nginx manually
	
	- create a docker image from the container OR convert docker container as 	
	  docker image
		$ docker commit nginx-container "nageshvkn/nginx-image"
	
	- check if image has been created
	  $ docker images

	- push the newly created image to docker hub
		$ docker login
		$ docker push nageshvkn/nginx-img


	- Customers can spin millions of new containers using below command.
		$ docker run -it nageshvkn/nginx-img /bin/bash


PROJECT-2:
=============
DAY-6:
# Creating docker image using "docker build" command
=================
	- mkdir webapp 
	- cd webapp
	- touch Dockerfile

	--> 'webapp' directory is called "context" or "build context".
		It contains the code, files or other data that you want to include in the image.
	
	- Write Dokckerfile:
		FROM ubuntu:16.04
		MAINTAINER "info@gamutgurus.com"
		RUN apt-get update
		RUN apt-get install -y nginx
		COPY index.html /var/www/html
		ENTRYPOINT service nginx start && bash

index.html:
=======
<html>
   <body style="background-color:powderblue;">
     <h1 style="color:red;">Gamug Gurus Online Training Portal</h1>
	</body> 
</html>
 	
# Building docker image:
	$ cd webapp
	$ docker build -t "nageshvkn/nginx-img" .

# Listing docker image
$ docker images

# Pushing custom images to docker repository
	$ docker login
	$ docker push gamut/nginx-image

#
Testing Image

# Creating a new container from our image
	$ docker run -it --name nginx-container nageshvkn/nginx-img /bin/bash

# Verify if nginx is running from the container.
	$ http://172.17.0.2:80



# Creating docker hub account
- Docker Hub (https://hub.docker.com/)
	- Each Repository can contain multiple images
	- Images are Identified using tags.

	
#
User Images Syntax:
	nageshvkn/nginx (username/imagename)

Official Images Syntax:
	ubuntu

User images are controled by Docker users.
official images are controled by Docker core team.


# Specifying Image via tags
	- ubuntu:14.04
	  ubuntu- is image name
	  14.04 - is called tag

# Pulling the images
	- docker pull centos

# Searching docker images in docker hub
	- docker search puppet
	- docker search jenkins


# Deleting an Image
	- docker rmi gamut/nginx

# Deleting all Images
	- docker rmi `docker images -q`


DAY-7:
#
Docker Image layers
=========================
- Checking the history of our docker image
	$ docker history <Image-Id>

# Build image without existing image	
	- Use --no-cache option
	$ docker build --no-cache -t="username/imagename" .


# Container creation process
  How contaner is created:
		
		Writable Layer		
		-		
		Gamutkart application		
		Apache image
		nginx image
		-		
		Ubuntu Base Image(rootfs)
		-
		Bootfs:
		    cgroups, namespace, divicemapper/aufs..etc.
		Kernel


DAY-8:
Gamutkart Real application;
============================
- Build and deployments with Docker containers.
- Real Containerization with Docker.
- Creating dockerized environments.

Question:
How are you using docker containerization tool for your builds and deployments?
Can you explain your Docker environment?
can you explain how you have implemented Docker in your project?

1. Clone the source code from Git or any other V.C.S
2. Build the code using your favourate build tool Maven/ANT
3. Create docker image for the application(gamutkart) with
   war file, tomcat,n...etc.

4. Create docker containers using create_env.sh 10
5. Launch the gamutkart application from all containers.

Step:3 --> creating docker image for gamutkart with tomcat 
		   server.
Dockerfile:
	FROM tomcat:8.0
	COPY gamutkart.war /usr/local/tomcat/webapps
	ENTRYPOINT /usr/local/tomcat/bin/startup.sh && bash

Build the Image:
	$ docker build -t "gamut/gamutkart" .

Step:4
Create the container manually using below command or user our 'create-env.sh' script.	
	$ docker run --name gamutkart_server -d -it --rm nageshvkn/gamutkart /bin/bash

Step:5
	http://IP:8080/gamutkart

Docker and Jenkins Integration



Notes:
======
#
Docker Benefits:
=================
1. Portability: 
	ship environments from one type of infrastructure to another without building up new VMs and tearing down the old ones.

2. Quick deployment/Teardown:
	With a single command, you can spin up new containers or tear down existing ones. If you want to clone a new VM, you are looking at waiting for close to or over a few hours. With Docker, it will take a few minutes to achieve what you need.

3. Consistency:
	No more of the "works on my machine!" excuse. As
everyone uses the same images to work, consistency is always guaranteed.
	All the container will act the same in your environment as it will on others.

4. Managing infrastructure-like code:
When it comes to upgrades, you can simply update your Dockerfile, and then tear down the old one. This helps not only with updates, but it can also help with rollbacks as well.

# 
Manage/Run Docker as a non-root user
==========================
Run docker command without sudo.	
------
	1. Create the "docker" group
		$ sudo groupadd docker

	2. Add your user to this group
		$ sudo usermod -aG docker gamut

	3. Logout and Login back so that your group membership
	   is re-evaluated.

	4. Check group existance:
		$ sudo grep docker /etc/group

	5. Delete the group
		$ sudo groupdel docker
	
	6. You can use 'gpasswd' command to remove the user from the group or add the 
	   User to the group.
		$ sudo gpasswd -d gamut docker
		$ sudo gpasswd -a gamut docker

docker compose
==============
In the words of Docker Inc.

Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. With Compose, you use a YAML file to configure your application’s services. Then, with a single command,you create and start all the services from your configuration.

Docker compose Installation
=============================
step-1

Download the Docker Compose binary into the /usr/local/bin directory with the following curl command:

sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.23.1/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose

step-2
Once the download is complete, apply executable permissions to the Compose binary:

sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose

step-3
Verify the installation by running the following command which will display the Compose version:

docker-compose --version
The output will look something like this: docker-compose version 1.23.1, build b02f1306
step-4
Start by creating a project directory and navigating into it:
mkdir my_app
cd my_app
step-5
Launch your text editor and create a file named docker-compose.yml inside the project directory:

$ vim docker-compose.yml ( ref docker-compose.yml file)
step-6
From the project directory, start up the WordPress application by running the following command:

  $ docker-compose up  
                    ******* or ********
You can also start the Compose in a detached mode by passing the -d flag.

 $ docker-compose up -d

If you want to remove or stop the containers entirely use the down option:

 $ docker-compose down / stop

Passing the --volumes switch will also remove the data volumes:

docker-compose down --volumes

step-7

If for any reason you want to uninstall Docker Compose you can simply delete the binary by typing:

sudo rm /usr/local/bin/docker-compose

Docker volume
==============
Volumes are the preferred mechanism for persisting data generated by and used by Docker containers. While bind mounts are dependent on the directory structure of the host machine, volumes are completely managed by Docker. Volumes have several advantages over bind mounts:

Volumes are easier to back up or migrate than bind mounts.
You can manage volumes using Docker CLI commands or the Docker API.
Volumes work on both Linux and Windows containers.
Volumes can be more safely shared among multiple containers.
Volume drivers let you store volumes on remote hosts or cloud providers, to encrypt the contents of volumes, or to add other functionality.
New volumes can have their content pre-populated by a container.


How to create volume /delete/list
$ docker volume //get information
$ docker volume create/ls/rm/inspect/prune


Use of docker volume
Decoupling container from storage
share(data/storage) amoung different containers
Attach volume to container
On deleting container volume doesn't delete 

Docker volume examples using Jenkins
====================================
First pull the jenkins image
then, using that we can create the containers

1. docker run --name my_jenkins1 -v myvol1:/var/jenkins_home -p 8080:8080 -p 50000:50000 jenkins
                    (containername) ( dockvol) ( jenkinsvol)   

2. docker run --name my_jenkins2 -v myvol1:/var/jenkins_home -p 9191:8080 -p 49000:50000 jenkins
                    (containername) ( dockvol) ( jenkinsvol)

1. docker run --name my_jenkins3 -v /home/sai/dockervolume:/var/jenkins_home -p 9090:8080 -p 40000:50000 jenkins
                    (containername)     ( user location vol)             ( jenkinsvol)


docker run -ti -v "$PWD/dir1":/dir1 -v "$PWD/dir2":/dir2 newimagename /bin/bash
docker run -ti --name my_jenkins3 -v /home/sai/dockervolume:/var/jenkins_home -p 9090:8080 -p 40000:50000 jenkins /bin/bash

docker networking
=================

docker network ls/create/inspect/rm/prune/connect/disconnect

How to create network driver in docker 
 
docker network create --driver bridge/none/host name
                                 (diff drivers)   (name of drive)

docker default networks
